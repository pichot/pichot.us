    Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jonathan Pichot. 
  </h3>
  <p>
    I'm an urbanist, technologist, and endlessly curious person.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently helping build a <a href="https://incubateur.anct.gouv.fr">digital service incubator</a>,
    as part of the <a href="https://beta.gouv.fr/">Beta.gouv.fr</a> ecosystem,
    in the French government's <abbr title="essentially, a national agency focused on supporting local governments"><a href="https://agence-cohesion-territoires.gouv.fr">Agence nationale de la cohÃ©sion des territoires</a></abbr>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've spent much of my career helping governments build better software, often for cities. I've been a full stack developer, product manager, and public sector entrepreneur. Previously, 
    I've worked for <a href="https://labs.planning.nyc.gov/">NYC Planning Labs</a>, <a href="https://downtowngr.org/">Downtown Grand Rapids Inc</a>, and
    <abbr title="Rapid Development Group">

    I've taught GIS at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and introductory javascript at the Factory in Grand Rapids.
    I occasionally speak about my work at conferences and events.
  <p>
  <p>
    I care deeply about cities and communities. I've founded and run volunteer groups, I've been a neighborhood block captain,
    and I've studied cities through data.
