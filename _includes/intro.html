    Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jonathan Pichot. 
  </h3>
  <p>
    I'm an urbanist, technologist, and endlessly curious person. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I've spent much of my career helping governments build better software, often for cities. I've been a full stack developer, product manager, and public sector entrepreneur, including:
  
    <ul>
      <li>Leading the technical strategy and EU business development for <a href="https://www.helpfulplaces.com">Helpful Places</a>, a startup helping make technology in public space more transparent and empowering to communities.</li>

        a publicly-funded incubator, part of the <a href="https://beta.gouv.fr">Beta.gouv ecosystem</a>, focused on building open source software for French local governments.</li>
      <li>Working at <a href="https://labs.planning.nyc.gov/">NYC Planning Labs</a> where I spearheaded a product to automate the environmental review process, amongst other things.</li>
      <li>Consulting on data and digital strategy for <a href="https://downtowngr.org/">Downtown Grand Rapids Inc</a>.</li>

    </ul>

    I've taught GIS at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and introductory javascript at the Factory in Grand Rapids.
    I occasionally speak about my work at conferences and events.
  <p>
  <p>
    I'm currently working as an independent contractor focused on digital product discovery, development, and deployment with a strong focus on cities and the built environment.
    I'm actively looking for other projects, particularly those that touch on urbanism, energy, data, and mapping.

    I care deeply about cities and communities. I've founded and run volunteer groups, I've been a neighborhood block captain,
    and I've studied cities through data.
