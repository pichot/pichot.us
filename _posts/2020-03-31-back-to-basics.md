title: Back to basics
---

I've finally rebuilt a personal website I'm proud of. I did it by going back to basics.

I'm using Jekyll, a simple, battle-tested static site generator. It feels good to write some plain HTML again. To dive into MDN and learn some new things about `<abbr>`. I've been working professionally at such a high level of abstraction, it's refreshing to remind myself what the foundational technologies are. It's getting my hands dirty. In the end, we're all still just slinging hypertext.

I built my first website in fourth grade, using Dreamweaver. A website of links to other things I liked. There's something to be said about what we lost from those days. Hypertext pages, links, content. No fussy javascript, tracking scripts, ads, and complex metatags. Just text on a page.

I've been around the web long enough to see the majority tools I've ever used go extinct. The <abbr title="wasteful?">creative</abbr> destruction of frameworks and languages continues unabated. Recently, reading about vuejs and react, I can't help but feel like we've been here before, and will be here again. Again and again.

Maybe it's because I'm getting older. Maybe it's the realization that a given technology is rarely what makes a project successful (see: service design, value proposition, patience). Maybe it's because I consider myself a part of the Rails generation, coming of age as a programmer influenced by the elegant conventions, patterns, and opinion's of [DHH](https://twitter.com/dhh)'s opus. Whatever it is, I'm happiest with well built tools that have stood the test of time <abbr title="5+ ?">(in internet years)</abbr>, trends be damned.

You know what won't be going extinct? HTML, CSS, some links and content. The basics.
