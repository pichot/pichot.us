After joining NYC government, I quickly became convinced of the need for product managers within the organization. To advocate for the role, I organized a presentation and panel discussion during the [2018 NYC Open Data week](https://www.open-data.nyc/).

The panelists who joined me were:

- [Rachel Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelmeadesmith/), content strategist @ NYC Digital
- [Timothy Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothymartin76/), chief analytics officer @ NYC Department of Buildings
- [Darnell Sessoms](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsessoms/), product manager @ NYC Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity
