In 2019, I presented at [NYC School of Data](https://schoolofdata.nyc/), an all day celebration of all things open data. My talk focused on a few fundamental unique identifiers found in many NYC open geospatial datasets.

The identifiers I discussed were:

- Borough, block, lot (BBL)
- Building identifier number (BIN)
- Addresses
- Street Segment IDs

The talk is certainly not comprehensive, but was meant as a gentle introduction to all the caveats (and fascinating challenges) that comes with trying to uniquely identify infrastructure in a fast-changing and complex city.
